## Overview

This mini-project is a multi-step form which is ubuqitous in this day and age. It shows different stages of a form as you progress. It also prevents some invalid actions. I worked on this to improve my understanding of ReactJS as well as Redux Toolkit and Material UI components.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- Complete each step of the sequence
- Go back to a previous step to update their selections
- See a summary of their selections on the final step and confirm their order
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page
- Receive form validation messages if:
  - A field has been missed
  - The email address is not formatted correctly
  - A step is submitted, but no selection has been made

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Redux Toolkit](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/) - A State Management tool
- [Material UI](https://mui.com/) - UI Component Library

### What I learned

I learned a number of things during this project. They are as follows:

- [x] I learned how to use Redux Toolkit
- [x] I improved my understanding of React hooks
- [x] I learned how to use Material UI components and their API
- [x] I learned how to use Formik and Yup for form validation
- [x] I learned how to use the React Router v6

### Continued development

- An improvement that can be made to the project would be that buttons on each form stage to be disabled until the form passes the Yup validation
- Also, automated testing can be implemented.
